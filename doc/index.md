## Install DeviceInfo
Before you can use this library, you'll need to <a href="userguide/installation.html">install it</a>. The simplest way to install the latest version of DeviceInfo is by using the [Twinpack Package Manager](https://github.com/Zeugwerk/Twinpack).

But you can also compile the library ourself or use a precompiled library. This library has ZCore as dependencies which will also automatically be sourced via Twinpack. However, be aware that you will need a license for ZCore to use it in your projects.
